# Ghidra Malware Analysis Project

Overview
--------
This repository is a safe, hands-on tutorial and toolkit for learning how to disassemble and analyze binaries with Ghidra. It is intended for defensive research, education, and practice using benign samples or synthetic data. It intentionally avoids shipping active malware.

Project objectives
------------------
- Provide a step-by-step guide to disassembling and analyzing binaries with Ghidra.
- Help readers identify common malware-like behaviours (persistence, anti-analysis, network usage) in a safe and controlled way.
- Provide example scripts to automate repetitive tasks and a report template for documenting findings.

Safety note
-----------
Always work inside an isolated virtual machine that has no network access (or a controlled network) when analyzing untrusted binaries. This repository provides benign/synthetic samples only.

Requirements
------------
- Ghidra (9.x or later recommended)
- Java 11+ (as required by the Ghidra version)
- Python 3.x for helper scripts (these scripts do not execute untrusted code)
- A VM for dynamic analysis (optional and outside the scope of this repo)

Repository structure
--------------------
See the `ghidra-malware-analysis-project/` tree. Key directories:

- `docs/` - step-by-step tutorial markdown files
- `scripts/` - helper scripts (string extraction, network indicator scanning, Ghidra labeling examples)
- `samples/` - benign sample hex and a dummy binary generator script
- `templates/` - analysis report template
- `screenshots/` - placeholder images for documentation

Getting started
---------------
1. Review the safety note above and ensure you have an isolated analysis environment.
2. Read `docs/Tutorial_Step1.md` to set up your environment.
3. Use the `scripts/generate_dummy_sample.py` script to create a benign sample to explore with Ghidra.
4. Open the sample in Ghidra and follow the tutorial steps.

Contributing
------------
Contributions are welcome: add more benign samples, scripts, or expanded tutorials. Please keep contributions safe and do not submit live malware.
